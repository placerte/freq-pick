# Monkey Test

It looks like the first pass missed a couple of points:

- [x] No keymap on screen
  - [ ] Key map now on screen but aftertought keep only "h help" visible by default and put everything else in the help box. the default minimal "h help" key map should be located directly under the frequency box (update positioning if not automatic)
- [ ] no rectangular selection box again. don't know which matplotlib version. I assume the latest by default?
